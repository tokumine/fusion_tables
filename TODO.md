* YARD docs



API wishlist
=============
* Bulk UPDATE
* response format in json/xml
* "create table" should return name
* describe table should include name
* multiple batch statements for all actions (only insert now). Need on all other commands. Better SQL.
* docs need updating, esp on response codes
* response codes need to be more standardised
* irritating can't include ROWID with * in selects
* add columns
* better heatmaps - scale is wonky
